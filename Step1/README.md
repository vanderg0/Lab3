## Step 1: Creating Figures from Mocap Data

### Download Instructions for Step 1
For Step 1, you will need to write MATLAB or Python code (the choice is yours). If you use Python, you can develop on either your own machine or eceprog. If you wish to use MATLAB, this will need to be done on your own machine, so you will need to download the starter code onto your personal machine. This can be done in two ways.

1. My preferred way to do this is to refer to Lab1/Step1 and set up ssh-keys which connect your personal computer to github.itap.purdue.edu. Then, you can run a `git clone` command to download the entire repository. If you are on windows, you may need to download git (I use [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) 64-bit version), but MacOS and Linux users should have git installed by default. If you don't know if you have git installed on your machine, just run `git -v` from any terminal or command prompt window. On my Windows PC, I got following message which confirms that I have git installed on my personal machine.
```bash
C:\Users\logan\...\Lab2\>git -v
git version 2.41.0.windows.3
```

2. Alternatively, you can download the repository as a .zip file. Go to main page of your personal Lab2 git repo, click on the green `Code` button and then press `Download ZIP`. The downside of this method is that you will have to manually upload your files to github (drag and drop the files) and you won't be able to use the power of git version control when developing your code.

### Instructions
Step 1 can be completed in MATLAB (recommended) or Python (if you prefer). The instructions for Step 1 are within the [Overleaf file](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mwyhydwdqwpd#716360). Please refer to the MATLAB or Python folders, whatever you prefer.
