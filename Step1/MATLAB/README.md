## MATLAB Users
We recommend writing your (starter) MATLAB code in a `.mlx `file for the best experience. However, we are only grading your Figures so you may elect to use `.m` files if you prefer that. Each of your MATLAB functions will be written in `.m` files.

Tutorials for MATLAB are provided in these files. If you haven't used MATLAB in a while, they will be helpful for this assignment.
* [Lab3_Tutorial.mlx](Lab3_Tutorial.mlx)  (note: .mlx files won't render on GitHub. You must open them in MATLAB)
* [Lab3_Tutorial.m](Lab3_Tutorial.m)
* [Lab3_Tutorial.pdf](Lab3_Tutorial.pdf)

Starter Code for Step 1 can be found at:
* [Lab3_StarterCode.mlx](Lab3_StarterCode.mlx) (note: .mlx files won't render on GitHub. You must open them in MATLAB)
* [Lab3_StarterCode.m](Lab3_StarterCode.m)
* [Lab3_StarterCode.pdf](Lab3_StarterCode.pdf)

The functions you need to implement in Step 1c are in:
* [ECE569_so3ToVec.m](ECE569_so3ToVec.m)
* [ECE569_VecToso3.m](ECE569_VecToso3.m)
* [ECE569_AxisAng3.m](ECE569_AxisAng3.m)
* [ECE569_MatrixLog3.m](ECE569_MatrixLog3.m)

Test Benches are .m files. You can run all tests with the `runtests` commmand in the MATLAB Command Window. These files should not be modfied, but you can of course open them to see what the tests are.
* [so3ToVecTest.m](so3ToVecTest.m)
* [VecToso3Test.m](VecToso3Test.m)
* [AxisAng3Test.m](AxisAng3Test.m)
* [MatrixLog3Test.m](MatrixLog3Test.m)
